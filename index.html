      Hello there, if you want insights into bible, prayer and life take a look! It's my goal to explore and take in
   the glimpses of wonder throughout the God's creation. Van Gogh once said to find things beautiful in this world
   because the world finds too little beautiful. My desire, with this website, is to recover the beauties that have
   always been right in front of me.
