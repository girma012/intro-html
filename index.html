      Hello there, and welcome! It's my goal to explore and take in the glimpses of wonder throughout God's creation. 
      Van Gogh once said to find things beautiful in this world because the world finds too little beautiful. 
      My desire, with this website, is to recover the beauties that have always been right in front of me. The beauties
      we consider mundane.
